- **Scenario Name** - Automatic Sizing Lab
- **Vendor Model** - Nutanix Models
- **Scenario Objectives**:
- **Executive Summary** - NSE would like to move existing dev cluster to AHV on Nutanix from VMware ESXi and existing 3-tier.
- **Requirements** - Any information you have regarding Requirements.
- **Constraints** - Any information you have regarding Constraints.
- **Assumptions** - Any information you have regarding Assumptions.

Add Workloads
.............

Click the :fa:`ellipsis-v`, and then click **Import Workloads**.

Click **Upload File**, and point to the RVTools export you downloaded above.

.. note::

  When importing RVTools into Sizer, it will only account for **Powered On** VMs.

Review Recommended Nodes
........................

We see that Sizer has selected a NX-1465S-G5 (4 x NX1065s-G5 Nodes).

The S signifies that this is a SMB node. Lets remove all of the SMB models as an option from the Automatic sizing.

Click on **Modify**

Locate the NX-1065S-G5 & NX-1075S-G5 under **Regular Models**, and uncheck them.

Review the other options you can change for an Automatic sizing:

- Sizing Options:
- Cluster Type - Allows you to size with the same node type, or mixed node type.
- Failover - Allows you to manipulate the N+* rate between 0 and 2.
- Storage - Allows you to explicitly select Hybrid or All Flash disks.
- Model Type - Allows you to chose the model type.

- Threshold - Allows you to change the threshold that Sizer uses for CPU/Memory/HDD/SDD

.. note::

  You can get help / explanation of an item any time by clicking on the :fa:`question-circle`

When you are done reviewing the items, click **Apply**.

We now see that Sizer has chose a NX-1365-G5 (All Flash) for this opportunity.

Reviewing The Automatic Sizing
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As we review what Sizer has chosen, and relate it back to the Prospect or Customer, a couple things come to mind.

First, we know this opportunity may be budget constrained. This being the case, a NX-1365-G5 is a good starting point, and allows them grow easily with the remaining slot open for a fourth NX-1065-G5 node.

Second, single socket CPU is not the best choice for development environments. This is why it is good to eliminate the SMB models.

Our next step is to download the BOM for review with the Prospect or Customer.

Click the :fa:`ellipsis-v`, and then click **Download BOM**.

Ensure that all options are checked, and click **Download**.

Takeaways
+++++++++

- Sizer makes it easy to work with RVTools exports, and allows for importing.
- Even when doing an Automatic sizing you have dials/options you can manipulate to narrow down the sizing.
